This theme relies on CSS3 to render rounded corners, gradients, transparency, and all sorts of good stuff. IE8 is supported - minus some visual flair. 

Legacy IE sees a boxy, significantly less polished layout. Given VCafe's target audience, I'm presume this is a tiny audience.

The theme options located in functions.php could use some more love - I did what I could with my rudimentary PHP - but an experienced developer should be able to put together a much more usable admin section. Two biggest enhancements: image upload and the ability to add a dynamic number of slides.
